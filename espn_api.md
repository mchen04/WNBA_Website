‚úÖ **Rebounds**: 1 pt - Available  
‚úÖ **Assists**: 1 pt - Available  
‚úÖ **Steals**: 2 pts - Available

‚úÖ **Turnovers** - Available (negative scoring option)  
‚úÖ **Free Throws Made/Attempted** - Available (from FT stat parsing)  

## üîß Recommended Implementation Strategy

### 1. Core Data Pipeline

```javascript
// Main statistics endpoint - updated daily
const coreStats = await fetch(`${ESPN_BASE_URL}/statistics`);

// Individual game tracking - real-time during games
const gameData = await fetch(`${ESPN_BASE_URL}/summary?event=${gameId}`);

// Health and availability - updated twice daily
const injuryData = await fetch(`${ESPN_BASE_URL}/injuries`);
```

### 2. Calculated Metrics

**Trade Value Algorithm:**
```
Trade Value = (PER * 0.4) + (Rating * 0.4) + (Consistency Score * 0.2)
Consistency Score = 100 - (Standard Deviation of Fantasy Points over last 10 games)
```

**Waiver Wire Algorithm:**
```
Waiver Score = (Recent Performance * 0.5) + (Games Played * 0.3) + (Injury Risk * 0.2)
Recent Performance = Average fantasy points over last 5 games
Games Played = Percentage of team games played
Injury Risk = 100 - (Current injury severity score)
```

**Consistency Metrics:**
```
Consistency = 100 - (Standard Deviation / Mean * 100)
Hot/Cold Streak = Performance vs season average over rolling periods
```

### 3. Data Update Frequency

| Data Type | Update Frequency | Endpoint |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Real-time game stats** | Every 30 minutes during games | `/summary?event={gameId}` |
| **Daily box scores** | Post-game (2-4 hours after) | `/summary?event={gameId}` |
| **Season statistics** | Daily at 6 AM EST | `/statistics` |
| **Injury reports** | Twice daily (10 AM, 6 PM) | `/injuries` |
| **Team schedules** | Weekly on Mondays | `/teams/{teamId}/schedule` |

### 4. Missing Data Handling

**DNP (Did Not Play) Tracking:**
- Available in box score data as `didNotPlay: true`
- Includes reason field for injury/rest/coach's decision
- Essential for injury rate calculations

**Historical Data:**
- ESPN provides historical statistics via season parameters
- Archive game-by-game data for trend analysis
- Store calculated metrics for performance comparison

### 5. Rate Limiting Strategy

```javascript
// Respectful API usage
const rateLimiter = {
  requests: 0,
  windowStart: Date.now(),
  maxRequests: 100, // per hour
  delayBetweenRequests: 2000 // 2 seconds
};
```

## üèÄ Key Implementation Insights

-- Add columns for advanced metrics
ALTER TABLE player_stats ADD COLUMN player_efficiency_rating DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE player_stats ADD COLUMN overall_rating DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE player_stats ADD COLUMN double_doubles INTEGER;

-- Track consistency metrics
CREATE TABLE player_consistency (
  player_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  season INTEGER,
  fantasy_points_variance DECIMAL(6,2),
  consistency_score DECIMAL(5,2),
  hot_streak_games INTEGER,
  cold_streak_games INTEGER
);

-- Enhanced injury tracking

const teams = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/teams`);

// Get specific team roster
const roster = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/teams/17/roster`);

// Get player stats
const coreUrl = 'https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/basketball/leagues/wnba/seasons/2025';
const playerStats = await fetch(`${coreUrl}/types/2/athletes/3149391/statistics`);
```

### Python Example
```python
import requests

base_url = "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/wnba"

# Get scoreboard
scoreboard = requests.get(f"{base_url}/scoreboard").json()

# Get team info
team_info = requests.get(f"{base_url}/teams/17").json()

# Get game summary
game_summary = requests.get(f"{base_url}/summary?event=401736171").json()
```

## Conclusion

ESPN's WNBA API provides comprehensive access to virtually all WNBA data needed for fantasy sports applications, statistical analysis, or fan engagement platforms. The combination of the site API and core API offers both high-level summaries and granular statistical data.

The API structure is well-organized and follows consistent patterns, making it relatively easy to build comprehensive WNBA applications. However, developers should implement proper error handling and caching strategies due to the unofficial nature of these endpoints.
