## üßÆ Advanced Analytics Algorithms

### Trade Value Calculation
```
Trade Value = (PER * 0.4) + (Rating * 0.4) + (Consistency Score * 0.2)
Consistency Score = 100 - (Standard Deviation of Fantasy Points over last 10 games)
```

### Waiver Wire Scoring
```
Weekly Score = Sum of projected fantasy points for all games that week (Monday-Sunday)
Daily Score = Projected fantasy points for that specific day's game
Projection = (Recent Performance + Season Average) / 2
Excludes: Injured players, rostered players
```

### Consistency Metrics
```
Consistency = 100 - (Standard Deviation / Mean * 100)
Hot/Cold Streak = Performance vs season average over rolling periods
```
